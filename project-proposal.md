# Project Name
    Special Delivery!

## Project Description
  There has never been a time when delivery can help more than during a time of crisis with homestay. This app will solve the question:  Is the store I need open? Are they doing curbside delivery? Then, after they have placed their order, they will put in a request for pickup and delivery. They get what they want delivered to their home. This can be groceries, Starbucks, DutchBros, or the local business up the street. We deliver.
