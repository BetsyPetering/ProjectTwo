## Project Description
  There has never been a time when delivery can help more than during a time of crisis with homestay. This app will solve the question:  How am I going to get this item I just purchased to my home? Log-in to our new app, tell us what you purhcased, from what store and their location, then what your location is, and we will deliver to you - for a fee, of course. We specialize in deliveries that need a pickup truck. We deliver.

  What deliver? App will ask customer what they need delivered, how may, the size and weight of items

  Choose type of vehicle delivery will need: bicycle, small vehicle, car, truck

  Time for delivery?

  Where from?

  Where are you?
